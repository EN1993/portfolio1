              <p>
               Mostly of the content are stored in worpress. Colour are <br>
               changed, after checking WCAG in devtool, which meet <br>
               triple A rate. Carousel/slider in the index file has been <br>
               changed in the JS(javascript).<br>
               Query fetching are adde in specific page.  <br>
               There are still a lot to be done. Because of delivery <br>

              <h4>How I changed:</h4>
              <p>
                First I created a new repo in github. When coding, I added root <br>
                property in css, which made it easy to change colour faster.<br>
                Had god help from tutor also.<br>

              <h4>Why I did it that way:</h4>
              <p>
                I put a lot of time, especially in the exam assignment,<br> 
                because I wanted to work more on what I did not quite<br>
                pass in the exam.

              <p>
                I added java script for the contact form. Took feedback <br>
